## Set up script

Download this script: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SixArm/sixarm_aws_examples/master/s3/aws-s3-upload-tester

Make it executable:

```
chmod +x aws-s3-upload-tester
```

Run it to see a diagnostic message:

```
./aws-s3-upload-tester
```


## Set up image

Create an image file such as `example.png` with any file name you want, in any place you want.

Run:

```
./aws-s3-upload-tester sonicapp example.png image/png
```


## Set up AWS credentials

If you see an error message that says anything about:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```

Then the next step is to set up your credentials.

You need this file from AWS:

```
credentials.csv
```

You can optionally save the credentials file in the default location:

```
mkdir $HOME/.aws
mv credentials.csv $HOME/.aws/
```

When you open the CSV file, such as in a spreadsheet app, you should the cells with your credentials.

You can opptionally set the credentials in your terminal shell, by editing your bash shell configuration file `$HOME/.profile` or your zsh shell configuration file `$HOME/.zshenv`, and setting your credentials:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

Open a new terminal window, then retry:

```
./aws-s3-upload-tester sonicapp example.png image/png
```

## Success?
